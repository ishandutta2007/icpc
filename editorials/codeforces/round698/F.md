## Problem description
Given $n$ segments with length $l_1,l_2,\cdots,l_n$ and an integer $k$, perform the folloring operation repeatedly until the maximum length over all segments does not exceed $k$:

- Pick a segment with probability proportional to its length $x$.
- Pick a real number $r\in (0,x)$ uniformly, then break the segment into two segments with length $r$ and $x-r$.

Calculate the expected number of operations under field $\mathtt{F}_{998244353}$.

## Constraints
- $1\le n\le 50$
- $1\le k\le 2000$
- $1\le l_i\le 2000$
- $1\le\sum_{i}l_i\le 2000$
